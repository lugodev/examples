/*
Here we will look at how to accept deposits. Each user will have their own deposit address.

1. You once generated a key pair and get corresponding address of your HOT wallet as described in the `common.js`.
   All payments from the user will first go to the user's deposit wallet, and then go to the HOT wallet.

2. When your user has to pay, you generate new wallet for him (as described in `common.js`).

3. You tell the user - please send N Toncoins to this wallet address.
   You can use a deeplink, by clicking on which the user will open the wallet app with all the fields filled in, if the wallet app is installed.
   ton://transfer/<wallet_address>?amount=<amount_in_nano>

4. Your backend is constantly subscribed to blocks appearing on the network.

5. Your backend iterates the transactions of each block, and if the transaction occurred on one of the deposit wallets, it is processed as a deposit.
